# SSH-for-Secure-and-Encrypted-Communication

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I configured and hardened an **SSH server on Ubuntu Linux** to ensure secure, encrypted remote communication. The work included **key-based authentication, SSH hardening, custom port configuration, strong cipher enforcement, and session timeout controls** to reduce exposure to brute-force attacks, credential interception, and man-in-the-middle attempts.

I validated the configuration by analyzing **Telnet vs SSH traffic in Wireshark**, highlighting how SSH ensures confidentiality and integrity of data.

##  Summary of Work
- Installed and configured **OpenSSH server** on Ubuntu.
- Hardened SSH by:
  - Disabling root login.
  - Turning off password authentication.
  - Moving SSH from port 22 to 2222.
  - Enforcing strong encryption ciphers (AES256, ChaCha20, AES-CTR families).
  - Applying idle session timeouts (ClientAlive settings).
- Implemented **SSH key-based authentication** (Ed25519 keys).
- Captured and compared **Telnet (plaintext) and SSH (encrypted)** traffic with Wireshark.
- Produced a final hardened **`sshd_config`** for reuse across lab or production environments.

##  Methodology
I followed a structured, repeatable process:

1. **Install & Enable OpenSSH** â€“ Confirmed service status and startup on boot.  
2. **Backup and Baseline Config** â€“ Saved default `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` before changes.  
3. **Apply Hardening Controls** â€“ Edited configuration to disable root/password logins, change port, restrict ciphers, and enforce session timeouts.  
4. **Deploy Key-Based Auth** â€“ Generated Ed25519 key pair, installed public key, corrected permissions, and validated login using `ssh -i` and custom port.  
5. **Traffic Analysis** â€“ Captured Telnet and SSH sessions in Wireshark; reviewed packet streams to illustrate plaintext vs encrypted traffic.  
6. **Validate & Document** â€“ Restarted SSH, re-tested access, and documented the final secure configuration and mitigated attack vectors.

##  Outcomes
- Eliminated password brute-force exposure by **requiring key authentication**.
- Blocked direct privilege escalation vectors by **disabling root login** over SSH.
- Reduced noise from automated bots by **changing the default port**.
- Strengthened confidentiality and integrity of remote admin sessions with **modern ciphers**.
- Verified that sensitive data does **not traverse the network in plaintext**, unlike Telnet.
- Produced a **portable hardened SSH config** you can reuse in other labs or cloud builds.

##  Skills Gained
- SSH server installation and hardening on Linux.  
- Key-based authentication setup (Ed25519).  
- Cryptographic cipher selection and enforcement.  
- Wireshark packet capture and protocol comparison (Telnet vs SSH).  
- Mitigating brute-force, MITM, and credential interception risks.  
- Session timeout and access control tuning.  
- Secure remote administration best practices and documentation.

##  What I Learned
This project showed me how quickly a default SSH install can be hardened into a **secure remote access gateway** that stands up against common attack techniques. Comparing Telnet and SSH traffic at the packet level made the value of encryption obvious: credentials that were fully exposed under Telnet became unreadable under SSH. I also learned the importance of layered controlsâ€”turning off root and passwords, enforcing keys, restricting ciphers, and timing out idle sessions all work together to limit the attack surface.
